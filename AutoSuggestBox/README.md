# XamarinFormsControls

I took the source for this project from the original DotMorten project at (https://github.com/dotMorten/XamarinFormsControls)
I wanted a Maui version. So I modified the source and migrated it to .Net Maui. It supports Windows, Android and iOS, 3 types of hardware I posses.
This was an exercise in how to migrate a Xamarin.Forms control to a .Net Maui control using the Maui Handler recipe. It took a number of days
to get this sorted out. I know that it works for my needs. I did what I needed to get it to work. I am sure there is some unused code that can be removed.
Someone familiar with Maui handlers and.or Windows code, iOS code or Android code can make improvements.
I tired of trying to find a comparable .Net Maui version of this AutoSuggestion box that I had used in Xamarin.Forms. I wanted to finish migrating my apps
from Xamarin.Forms to .Net Maui. After migrating this control and the Microcharts control, I was able to complete the migration to .Nwt Maui.
I do like .Net Maui now more than Xamarin.Forms. Yes, you need to make design changes but in fact it isnt that much of a stretch.

So many thanks to dotMorten for creating this control so long ago.
